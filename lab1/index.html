          <span style="font-weight: bold">Summary.</span> Contracts,
          transactions, and records of them provide critical structure in our
          economic system, but they haven’t kept up with the world’s digital
          transformation. They’re like rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1
          race car.

          Blockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology behind
          bitcoin, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records
          transactions safely, permanently, and very efficiently. For instance,
          while the transfer of a share of stock can now take up to a week, with
          blockchain it could happen in seconds. Blockchain could slash the cost
          of transactions and eliminate intermediaries like lawyers and bankers,
          and that could transform the economy. But, like the adoption of more
          internet technologies, blockchain’s adoption will require broad
          coordination and will take years. In this article the authors describe
          the path that blockchain is likely to follow and explain how firms
          should think about investments in it.

          Contracts, transactions, and the records of them are among the
          defining structures in our economic, legal, and political systems.
          They protect assets and set organizational boundaries. They establish
          and verify identities and chronicle events. They govern interactions
          among nations, organizations, communities, and individuals. They guide
          managerial and social action. And yet these critical tools and the
          bureaucracies formed to manage them have not kept up with the
          economy’s digital transformation. They’re like a rush-hour gridlock
          trapping a Formula 1 race car. In a digital world, the way we regulate
          and maintain administrative control has to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology at the heart
          of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open,
          distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties
          efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself
          can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically. (See the
          sidebar “How Blockchain Works.”)
        </p>
        <p>
          With blockchain, we can imagine a world in which contracts are
          embedded in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases,
          where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and revision. In
          this world every agreement, every process, every task, and every
          payment would have a digital record and signature that could be
          identified, validated, stored, and shared. Intermediaries like
          lawyers, brokers, and bankers might no longer be necessary.
          Individuals, organizations, machines, and algorithms would freely
          transact and interact with one another with little friction. This is
          the immense potential of blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, virtually everyone has heard the claim that blockchain will
          revolutionize business and redefine companies and economies. Although
          we share the enthusiasm for its potential, we worry about the hype.
          It’s not just security issues (such as the 2014 collapse of one
          bitcoin exchange and the more recent hacks of others) that concern us.
          Our experience studying technological innovation tells us that if
          there’s to be a blockchain revolution, many barriers—technological,
          governance, organizational, and even societal—will have to fall. It
          would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without
          understanding how it is likely to take hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          True blockchain-led transformation of business and government, we
          believe, is still many years away. That’s because blockchain is not a
          “disruptive” technology, which can attack a traditional business model
          with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly.
          Blockchain is a foundational technology: It has the potential to
          create new foundations for our economic and social systems. But while
          the impact will be enormous, it will take decades for blockchain to
          seep into our economic and social infrastructure. The process of
          adoption will be gradual and steady, not sudden, as waves of
          technological and institutional change gain momentum. That insight and
          its strategic implications are what we’ll explore in this article.
        </p>
        <h2>Patterns of Technology Adoption</h2>
        <p>
          Before jumping into blockchain strategy and investment, let’s reflect
          on what we know about technology adoption and, in particular, the
          transformation process typical of other foundational technologies. One
          of the most relevant examples is distributed computer networking
          technology, seen in the adoption of TCP/IP (transmission control
          protocol/internet protocol), which laid the groundwork for the
          development of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Introduced in 1972, TCP/IP first gained traction in a single-use case:
          as the basis for e-mail among the researchers on ARPAnet, the U.S.
          Department of Defense precursor to the commercial internet. Before
          TCP/IP, telecommunications architecture was based on “circuit
          switching,” in which connections between two parties or machines had
          to be preestablished and sustained throughout an exchange. To ensure
          that any two nodes could communicate, telecom service providers and
          equipment manufacturers had invested billions in building dedicated
          lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          TCP/IP turned that model on its head. The new protocol transmitted
          information by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small
          packets, each including address information. Once released into the
          network, the packets could take any route to the recipient. Smart
          sending and receiving nodes at the network’s edges could disassemble
          and reassemble the packets and interpret the encoded data. There was
          no need for dedicated private lines or massive infrastructure. TCP/IP
          created an open, shared public network without any central authority
          or party responsible for its maintenance and improvement.
        </p>
        <p>

          network, the packets could take any route to the recipient. Smart

          created an open, shared public network without any central authority
          or party responsible for its maintenance and improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          TCP/IP burst into broad public use with the advent of the World Wide
          Web in the mid-1990s. New technology companies quickly emerged to
          provide the “plumbing”—the hardware, software, and services needed to
          connect to the now-public network and exchange information. Netscape
          commercialized browsers, web servers, and other tools and components
          that aided the development and adoption of internet services and
          applications. Sun drove the development of Java, the
          application-programming language. As information on the web grew
          exponentially, Infoseek, Excite, AltaVista, and Yahoo were born to
          guide users around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once this basic infrastructure gained critical mass, a new generation
          of companies took advantage of low-cost connectivity by creating
          internet services that were compelling substitutes for existing
          businesses. CNET moved news online. Amazon offered more books for sale
          than any bookshop. Priceline and Expedia made it easier to buy airline
          tickets and brought unprecedented transparency to the process. The
          ability of these newcomers to get extensive reach at relatively low
          cost put significant pressure on traditional businesses like
          newspapers and brick-and-mortar retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relying on broad internet connectivity, the next wave of companies
          created novel, transformative applications that fundamentally changed
          the way businesses created and captured value. These companies were
          built on a new peer-to-peer architecture and generated value by
          coordinating distributed networks of users. Think of how eBay changed
          online retail through auctions, Napster changed the music industry,
          Skype changed telecommunications, and Google, which exploited
          user-generated links to provide more relevant results, changed web
          search.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Companies are already using blockchain to track items through complex
          supply chains.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Ultimately, it took more than 30 years for TCP/IP to move through all
          the phases—single use, localized use, substitution, and
          transformation—and reshape the economy. Today more than half the
          world’s most valuable public companies have internet-driven,
          platform-based business models. The very foundations of our economy
          have changed. Physical scale and unique intellectual property no
          longer confer unbeatable advantages; increasingly, the economic
          leaders are enterprises that act as “keystones,” proactively
          organizing, influencing, and coordinating widespread networks of
          communities, users, and organizations.
        </p>
        <h3>The New Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain—a peer-to-peer network that sits on top of the internet—was
          introduced in October 2008 as part of a proposal for bitcoin, a
          virtual currency system that eschewed a central authority for issuing
          currency, transferring ownership, and confirming transactions. Bitcoin
          is the first application of blockchain technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parallels between blockchain and TCP/IP are clear. Just as e-mail
          enabled bilateral messaging, bitcoin enables bilateral financial
          transactions. The development and maintenance of blockchain is open,
          distributed, and shared—just like TCP/IP’s. A team of volunteers
          around the world maintains the core software. And just like e-mail,
          bitcoin first caught on with an enthusiastic but relatively small
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          TCP/IP unlocked new economic value by dramatically lowering the cost
          of connections. Similarly, blockchain could dramatically reduce the
          cost of transactions. It has the potential to become the system of
          record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once
          again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of
          influence and control emerge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how business works now. Keeping ongoing records of
          transactions is a core function of any business. Those records track
          past actions and performance and guide planning for the future. They
          provide a view not only of how the organization works internally but
          also of the organization’s outside relationships. Every organization
          keeps its own records, and they’re private. Many organizations have no
          master ledger of all their activities; instead records are distributed
          across internal units and functions. The problem is, reconciling
          transactions across individual and private ledgers takes a lot of time
          and is prone to error.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a typical stock transaction can be executed within
          microseconds, often without human intervention. However, the
          settlement—the ownership transfer of the stock—can take as long as a
          week. That’s because the parties have no access to each other’s
          ledgers and can’t automatically verify that the assets are in fact
          owned and can be transferred. Instead a series of intermediaries act
          as guarantors of assets as the record of the transaction traverses
          organizations and the ledgers are individually updated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a blockchain system, the ledger is replicated in a large number of
          identical databases, each hosted and maintained by an interested
          party. When changes are entered in one copy, all the other copies are
          simultaneously updated. So as transactions occur, records of the value
          and assets exchanged are permanently entered in all ledgers. There is
          no need for third-party intermediaries to verify or transfer
          ownership. If a stock transaction took place on a blockchain-based
          system, it would be settled within seconds, securely and verifiably.
          (The infamous hacks that have hit bitcoin exchanges exposed weaknesses
          not in the blockchain itself but in separate systems linked to parties
          using the blockchain.)
        </p>
        <h3>A Framework for Blockchain Adoption</h3>
        <p>
          If bitcoin is like early e-mail, is blockchain decades from reaching
          its full potential? In our view the answer is a qualified yes. We
          can’t predict exactly how many years the transformation will take, but
          we can guess which kinds of applications will gain traction first and
          how blockchain’s broad acceptance will eventually come about.

            Technologies Take Hold
            </h2>

            />
          <p>
            The adoption of foundational technologies typically happens in four
            phases. Each phase is defined by the novelty of the ...
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In our analysis, history suggests that two dimensions affect how a
          foundational technology and its business use cases evolve. The first
          is novelty—the degree to which an application is new to the world. The
          more novel it is, the more effort will be required to ensure that
          users understand what problems it solves. The second dimension is
          complexity, represented by the level of ecosystem coordination
          involved—the number and diversity of parties that need to work
          together to produce value with the technology. For example, a social
          network with just one member is of little use; a social network is
          worthwhile only when many of your own connections have signed on to
          it. Other users of the application must be brought on board to
          generate value for all participants. The same will be true for many
          blockchain applications. And, as the scale and impact of those
          applications increase, their adoption will require significant
          institutional change.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve developed a framework that maps innovations against these two
          contextual dimensions, dividing them into quadrants. (See the exhibit
          “How Foundational Technologies Take Hold.”) Each quadrant represents a
          stage of technology development. Identifying which one a blockchain
          innovation falls into will help executives understand the types of
          challenges it presents, the level of collaboration and consensus it
          needs, and the legislative and regulatory efforts it will require. The
          map will also suggest what kind of processes and infrastructure must
          be established to facilitate the innovation’s adoption. Managers can
          use it to assess the state of blockchain development in any industry,
          as well as to evaluate strategic investments in their own blockchain
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Single use.</h3>
        <p>
          In the first quadrant are low-novelty and low-coordination
          applications that create better, less costly, highly focused
          solutions. E-mail, a cheap alternative to phone calls, faxes, and
          snail mail, was a single-use application for TCP/IP (even though its
          value rose with the number of users). Bitcoin, too, falls into this
          quadrant. Even in its early days, bitcoin offered immediate value to
          the few people who used it simply as an alternative payment method.
          (You can think of it as a complex e-mail that transfers not just
          information but also actual value.) At the end of 2016 the value of
          bitcoin transactions was expected to hit $92 billion. That’s still a
          rounding error compared with the $411 trillion in total global
          payments, but bitcoin is growing fast and increasingly important in
          contexts such as instant payments and foreign currency and asset
          trading, where the present financial system has limitations.
        </p>
        <h3>Localization.</h3>
        <p>
          The second quadrant comprises innovations that are relatively high in
          novelty but need only a limited number of users to create immediate
          value, so it’s still relatively easy to promote their adoption. If
          blockchain follows the path network technologies took in business, we
          can expect blockchain innovations to build on single-use applications
          to create local private networks on which multiple organizations are
          connected through a distributed ledger.

        <p>
          Much of the initial private blockchain-based development is taking
          place in the financial services sector, often within small networks of
          firms, so the coordination requirements are relatively modest. Nasdaq
          is working with Chain.com, one of many blockchain infrastructure
          providers, to offer technology for processing and validating financial
          transactions. Bank of America, JPMorgan, the New York Stock Exchange,
          Fidelity Investments, and Standard Chartered are testing blockchain
          technology as a replacement for paper-based and manual transaction
          processing in such areas as trade finance, foreign exchange,
          cross-border settlement, and securities settlement. The Bank of Canada
          is testing a digital currency called CAD-coin for interbank transfers.
          We anticipate a proliferation of private blockchains that serve
          specific purposes for various industries.
